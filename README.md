# Main Branch of Workshop Repo Makedonka_Tochevska

This is the **main branch** of the repository for the **Brainster Front-End Academy Workshops**. Each branch in this repository represents a separate project completed during the workshops.

The workshops are held every week, and we have **2 days** to complete each project. The curriculum starts with simpler tasks and gradually escalates to more challenging ones, allowing us to build our skills step by step. As the workshops progress, we tackle more advanced concepts, frameworks, and techniques, which are then reflected in the corresponding projects on different branches.

### Structure:

- **Main Branch**: Overview and central hub for all projects.
- **Other Branches**: Each branch contains a unique project or assignment from the workshops.

Feel free to explore and check out the individual projects on their respective branches to see the progression of skills and learning over time!
